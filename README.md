# dude
You can build some really great, fast, powerful frameworks using dude. As the maintainer of dude, I might have some bias, but I build dude because there was nothing else out there that did what it did. They, them, he, she, user, you, none of those gave me the results of dude.

## Using dude
To use dude run ./dude.sh <directory to apply dude>
